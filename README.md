# Pump
The buliding blocks for The Other Pancreas Pump.

In its current state the pump cannot be build unless you happen to have old Simblee devices lying around (Simblee is now end-of-life). If you do, then you should be able to use this code to get it going. You will need to design a PCB, as the current board was designed in a now defunct online system that is no longer available. The schematic can be found in "/pcb_schematic/v3 schematic.png" the list of components is in the "/pcb_schematic/component-schematic_mapping.txt" file.

The "/android_communication/PumpBluetooth.java" file is where you will find all of the code needed to implement your own communication with the pump.
